<h3>Blood, fluid that transports oxygen and nutrients to the cells and carries away carbon dioxide and other waste products. 
<br><br>
Technically, blood is a transport liquid pumped by the heart (or an equivalent structure) to all parts of the body, after which it is returned
<br><br>

 to the heart to repeat the process. Blood is both a tissue and a fluid. It is a tissue because it is a collection of similar specialized cells that
 <br><br>

 serve particular functions. These cells are suspended in a liquid matrix (plasma), which makes the blood a fluid. If blood flow ceases,
 <br><br>

 death will occur within minutes because of the effects of an unfavourable environment on highly susceptible cells.<h3>
